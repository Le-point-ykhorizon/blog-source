## Wanted Features

- [] hugo hierarchy categories and subcategories

        
Guess: 2 direction to implement this feature
1. use variable dynamically generate relationship to generate the hierarchy template 
2. Write another .js or go code to generate file in /date to maintain the categories relationship, then use data template to show result

- [] manage tags/catagories/keyword/series 
- [] image management
- [] drop-down nav bar for sub-directory
- [] search function (Google or inline search)
