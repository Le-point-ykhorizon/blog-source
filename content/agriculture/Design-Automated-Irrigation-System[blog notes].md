## Concepts before start 

Before we start to do the works (no matter design or implement), we need to set up our mind set and objectives. It can prevent us from wasting effort.

>  minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just __enough features__ to  gather validated learning about the product and its continued development.
>

* For startups, how to __know__ the __enough features__ is a art.
* For engineer / design, how to __implemtent__ those enough features __elegantly__ and __efficiently__

## Design Process

Several thing your need to know

Understand the need of your plant (Farming Management)
 
Understand what happen when irrigated water go into soil? ( Soil Hydraulic )

How to mechanical component and embedded computer (programming) intergate?

How to make embedded computer make a decision or control ?
