Here two motivations that why I write blog article:

- Write article for my self that force me to review (or preview) the learning material
    
    - Community meetup and event 
        - Reduce rely on slide of presenter and directly use slide content
        - try to use my own sentence or word to interpret it
    - Online and other course 
    - Tool learning/ new skill,tech practices

- Write article for other target audience 

    - Some thing can not find on internet
