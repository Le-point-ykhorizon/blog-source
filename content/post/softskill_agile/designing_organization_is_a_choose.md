__Notice__

> If your team is less than 10 people, the major factor of team is most about individual ability and skill instead of designing organization. However, when you are in a large team (>30 or more), organization design play a critical role to efficiency.

__Viewpoint__

>    - From a viewpoint of new gradated student(me), I summarized few points which impressed me.




### 1. All about objectives

- Every design(specifically means organization) should sets clear main objective and secondary objective.

When your team or company pursue cost-effective or efficiency as main objective, they would naturally take people as resource to maximize employee's working hour such as assigning multiple project.

While they think they are optimizing productivity of team, in reality, they oppositely diminished team productivity due some hidden factors such as context switch overhead.


### 2. Balance between objectives with long-term and short-term thinking

In this talk, speaker demonstrate several causal loop diagram(CLD) cases containing delay in the system. How to handle with delay such as tolerating building testing infrastructure without directly outcome and investing time to make team member to grow. This handling also represents mindset of manager(or company).


### 3. Be a cross-functional person

Cross-functional team member is not only you can efficiently cross-functional work to get the job done but also you are more __easily communicate with team__.

### 4. Think logically and aware mindset

Speaker also list many valuable objectives for organization design, so manager can set objectives with systems thinking to analyze factor-outcome(cause-effect) relationship.

__Objectives__

- Adaptability
- Product value
- Period time
- Efficiency
- Cost
  
On the other hand, people will trap with some "__common mindset__" such as:

- More feature means better product?
- Release (deploy) production cost is fixed?
- Planning cost is fixed?
- Abilities and skills of people is static?
- ... etc
