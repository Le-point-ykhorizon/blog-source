# History
## Diverge and Converge
The speaker shared about the evolution of software developing. If we looked back the history of software developing, all the requirement and architecture is simple. When complexity of application is increasing, developing team can not afford task of operations any more,such as loading balance and performance tuning. Naturally, seperating operations task into a standalone team called operations team resulted in degrade efficiency of whole team due to communication and task seperation overhead. Therefore, people start to come up with a new role to connect communication and collaboration between product management, software development, and operations professionals. That is the buzzword "[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)[1]".

## DevOps is a new thing?
Operations engineer solved system management problem with shell scrip(BASH) before the convenient tools invention like Ansible or Docker. This case can demostrate the importance of shell script. Although we feel the application is change which is more complicate and huge, the fundamental task is almost unchanged. Moreover, the concept of solution is unchanged, too.

For example, the fundamental concept of __microservice__ can be derived from [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)[2], Do One Thing and Do It Well. The only difference is the level of implementation.
