# Quality >> Quantity
__I must be more focus on quality than quantity in everything.__

Impressive thing and person alway present efficiency(cost and effect) and quality(simple and eleglant). 

In the begining of this blog, I set up a "daily bloggin challenge" for myself.
After 1 mouth quick testing and 1 mouth review pondering, I found that it's impractical.

I was used to take notes with [Qownnote](https://www.qownnotes.org/) and collect a lot of information which seem to useful or meaningful. But I carelessly forgot the important thing that collecting did not mean comprehending knowledges. Piling up a stack of learning material, courses and books is a illusion which make me feel weathly and so proud myself. 

In fact, class notes and rough learning notes are worthless beacuase they are not well-organized knowledge piece and without including personal perspectives.


At the bottom line, if I want to write a collecting information article, it should be well-organized and included personal perspectives.
