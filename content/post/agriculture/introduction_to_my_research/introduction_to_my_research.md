# My research work:
The following sentence is essential of my work.
	
	Purpose a self-adaptive control method and architecture for 
	small scale precise irrigation system with environmental sensing.

Purpose a framework

- Make farmer or culivator focus on planting, soil and environment
- Do not need to care hardware detail, like: spark, hadoop such framework

Privode 1 golden controller (plant + soil + weather integration)

## Motivation

According to our observation, rising of city farming is trend

- Food distance 
    -  Food waste in transportation 
    -  Carbon footprint
    -  Losting fresh
- Automation & Environmental sensing
    - Quantitative
    - Precision
- Oraganic
- Resource efficiency (Water,Fertilizer)

__*Addiotional__

- Sustainalbe


# Problems
    1.What is my design methodology / strategy to highly integration system ?
    2.How to schedule developing plan ?

## Guessing Design Strategy

- Requirement spec.
- List out all the tasks and analysis dependency
- Survey tool and learn method 
- Scheduling


Design controller(method) interacts with soil hydrology model in computer simulation 

develop a threshold version of prototype


Build the hardware integration

- Communication 
- Instrument crafting
- Experiment callibration

## What are obstacles ?


1. Theory developing environment lack of integration
	- soil model and control model is 
2. Seldom soil hydroluic model is open source / free
3. Do not have enough confidence to control theory

Need to study controller design formally

1. open my mind to consult agriculture expert
2. study basic plant & soil science


infrastructure

1. linux driver & embedded system learning is time consuming

Next part is to be continue...
