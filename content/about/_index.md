I born in [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) and grew up in urban. I'm interest in insect during my young age. 

I' frastrated by math in high school but I stil went EECS in universiy. (Haha! Math come back!)

Happily, I gradually conquer math or other weakness by developing my own learning method.

> Life is only one time. You can __barely change__ world but you can decide how to __think__  and __take actions__ to the world.

So try to do crazy thing and  try not to leave any regret in life.

Now, I still learn to be more focus but unstoppably explore new thing in the world. 

If you are interest in my project or anything else, contact me directly with mail or twitter.
