## Basic Concepts

### What is statistics?

    Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting (numerical) data.

### Population V.S. Sampling

( figure for describe relationship between Population & Sampling )

__Why sampling ?__

We can not understand ( or collect ) the whole population, so we only try to infer the whole picture of population with sampling.
Sample is portion of population
Census(普查) is the only way totally understand population.


    
__Is a sample representative?__

(This need to be survey)

Now, we have to introduce some common term for statistics. Let's get start!

### Terminology

#### Descriptive vs Inferential
Descriptive

- Graphical or numerical summaries of data.
- Describing (visualizing or summarizing) a set of data.

Inferential

- Making a “scientific guess” on unknowns.
- Trying to say something about the population.


#### Parameter vs Statistic
- A numerical summary of a population is a __parameter__.
- A numerical summary of a sample is a __statistic__.


### Levels of data measurement
- Nominal.
- Ordinal.
- Quantitative: interval or ratio.

#### Nominal

- Arithmetic operations cannot be applied on nominal data.
- No rank


#### Ordinal
 {% asset_img Ordinal.png %}


- Arithmetic operations cannot be applied on ordinal data.
- Can be rank


#### Quantitative (interval and ratio) levels
Example: 

- Degrees in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Heights, weights, income, prices.
qualitative (categorical): nominal, ordinal
quantitative (numeric): interval, ratio

## Data visualization
Here are some common chart for data visualization

- Frequency distributions
- Histograms
- Frequency polygons
- Line charts
- Pie charts
- Bar charts
- Scatter plot

### An Example 
How to get some feeling on 731 numbers?

#### Frequency distributions
 {% asset_img Full_frequency_distributions.png %}

Features

- Count
- Grouping data
- Observe outliers

#### Histograms
 {% asset_img Histograms.png %}

Features

- Contiguous rectangles

#### Frequency polygons
 {% asset_img Frequency_polygons.png %}


Features

- Compare multiple frequency distributions

#### Line charts
 {% asset_img Line_charts.png %}


Features

- Depict a time series data set

#### Pie Chart
 {% asset_img Pie_charts.png %}


Features

- Relative frequency distributions
- Not suitable for comparing averages

#### Bar Chart
 {% asset_img Bar_charts.png %}


Features

- Noncontiguous
- Visualizing the proportions of each categories
- Demonstrating the di↵erences

#### Bar Chart v.s. Histograms
 {% asset_img Bar_charts_vs_histograms.png %}


A bar chart uses noncontiguous bars to visualize categorical data.

A histogram uses contiguous bars to visualize quantitative data.

#### Scatter Plot
 {% asset_img Scatter_plot.png %}

two vales are both measured in quantitative scales
