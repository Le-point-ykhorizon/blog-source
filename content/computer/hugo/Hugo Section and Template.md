> Try to organize your stuff.

# Purposes

- Learn __section__ idea with __layout__ assignment
- Meaning of hugo __type__ and __layout__ keyword front matter in .md
- Meaning of hugo __archetype__ 

# Hugo Section Idea

In hugo, every folder under content we call it a "__section__". You have to organize your file in your own way that
can reduce the extra configuration for hugo.



> It's a great design idea! I had used hexo for 1 year and publish 30+ article. 
> It some kind of messy and hard to manage. Hexo depend on cli command to solve this problem.

# What do I need?

1. Create a new __archetype__ in __<path to blog root>/archetypes__ (P.S You also could crete in theme/<your theme>/archetype)

2. Create a new aritcle in your __[path to blog root]/content/[section]__ 

> section actually is subfolder in content also
