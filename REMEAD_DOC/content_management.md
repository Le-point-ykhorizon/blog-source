# PART II: Content Management Experience


## Find file by title/filename in multilingual condition
I'm used to write blog by Visual Studio Code, so my procedure likes

1. Start local server in command line (hugo server -w -D)
2. View the blog in browser and find the title of the article which I want to work on
3. Use **search in file** access article by title
4. It's time to get to write!

## Manage tags/catagories/keyword/series 

1. Every article only have one category. It should be the most important characteristic.
2. Category should not equal to tag

## How to hybrid directory(section), category and tag to manage contents ?

## Suggestions for writing flow 

__Keep Atomicity__

- Finish a complete part of article in one writing work and don't let muse fleeing.
- Immediately deploy article after finishing, like developer commit code with git.
